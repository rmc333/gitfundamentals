# git init
the 'git init' command is used to create an empty git repository
if you wanted to create a new directoryand initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir newdirectory
cd newdirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md), [add](./add.md), [commit](./commit.md,), [push](./push.md) and more. 
    init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
